        The School was founded by Late Dr C.T. Abraham, who had extensive experience in the field of education in India and the USA.
         Though he is no more, the high ideals and principles he embodied are inherited by his successors.
         The management is composed of individuals with rich experience in the field of education both in India and abroad. 
         Little Rockâ€™s global vision of education is the obvious result of such an enlightened leadership.
